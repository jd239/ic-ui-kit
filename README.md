The [Intelligence Community Design System](https://design.sis.gov.uk) helps the United Kingdom's Intelligence Community (MI6, GCHQ, MI5, and HMGCC, our national security partner, along with additional partners) to quickly build powerful capabilities that are accessible and easy to use.

This is a joint project led by [MI6](https://www.sis.gov.uk), working with [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk), [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk) and [HMGCC](https://www.hmgcc.gov.uk) (our national security partner).

This repository holds the UI Kit components. Find the guidance and content of [`design.sis.gov.uk`](https://design.sis.gov.uk) in the [IC Design System guidance site repository](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system).

## Why we're doing this

We build a lot of stuff that needs to be quick-to-build, usable and always accessible. We build using a lot of different tech, so creating something that can be consistently accessible and usable across different stacks is critical for us.

The Design System is being used to build our powerful, flexible and complex capabilities that help keep the UK safe and prosperous.

üìñ [Read our story](https://design.sis.gov.uk/get-started/a-design-system) to learn more on why we've created our own design system.

### Learning from the best

We track many sources of accessibility expertise, as well as using our internal experts and communities. For example, many of our patterns and components are based on awesome work from the [Government Digital Service (GDS) Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). Where we can, we'll contribute back!

If you think we could improve something, please do [raise an issue](https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/issues/new/choose).

## Installing

To install the components, no additional configuration is needed for internal systems. Choose a package depending on which framework you're building with:

* Install the [web component package](packages/web-components/README.md) for use standalone, or with [Svelte](https://design.sis.gov.uk/get-started/install-components/svelte), [Vue](https://design.sis.gov.uk/get-started/install-components/vue) and other web component-compatible frameworks.
* Install the [React component package](packages/react/README.md) for React-based projects.

## Developing

You can optionally install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to use the correct node version. After installing nvm on your machine, install the suitable node version:

```console
nvm i
```

This is a monorepo using [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). To get started is simple:

```console
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

Storybook is used during development; this command will launch separate web components and React Storybooks.

```console
npm run storybook
```

## Local build and install

Developers are able to build and install components locally, enabling effective testing of apps and IC UI kit components in a local environment.

To get started make sure you are in the top-level directory of `ic-ui-kit`:

```console
npm run build
cd packages/docs
npm pack
cd ../fonts
npm pack
cd ../react
npm pack
cd ../web-components
npm pack
```
Alternatively, you can use the [`build-tar.sh` script](./build-tar.sh) to do the same.

In the `package.json` of your project replace the value of `@ukic/docs`, `@ukic/fonts`, `@ukic/react` and `@ukic/web-components` with the full filepath to the .tgz file in each respective directory, for example:

### [./package.json](https://github.com/mi6/ic-ui-kit/blob/main/package.json)

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@ukic/docs": "../ic-ui-kit/packages/docs/ukic-docs-2.1.0-beta.17.tgz"
  "@ukic/fonts": "../ic-ui-kit/packages/fonts/ukic-fonts-2.1.0-beta.17.tgz",
  "@ukic/react": "../ic-ui-kit/packages/react/ukic-react-2.1.0-beta.17.tgz",
  "@ukic/web-components": "../ic-ui-kit/packages/web-components/ukic-web-components-2.1.0-beta.17.tgz",
}
```

Finally, install the dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

## Faster development building with ic-design-system

If you want to build the components in this repository and use them in [`ic-design-system`](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system), you can use `npm link`.
This will speed up development because you do not have to generate a compressed npm package, but rather directly use the package after building it locally.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to rebuild the package after every change

First, build the monorepo packages in the top-level directory of `ic-ui-kit`:

```console
npm run build
```

For canary:

```console
npm run build:canary
```

To build everything:

```console
npm run build:all
```

Then, to use the package, make sure you are in the top-level directory of `ic-design-system`. You will need to link the generated build from `ic-ui-kit`, e.g.: 

```console
npm link ../path/to/ic-ui-kit/packages/react
```

For canary:

```console
npm link ../path/to/ic-ui-kit/packages/canary-react
```

> [!NOTE]
> Now you can develop and debug faster with `ic-ui-kit` in `ic-design-system`.
